\section{Installation}
The project uses Maven/Tycho for test, build and deployment of the Eclipse 
application. For the installation of Maven/Tycho please be referred to the 
corresponding documentation \cite{} and \cite{}. Please note that Tycho requires
Maven 3.

The build process is initialised with the following command, where the target 
platform points to the corresponding Eclipse (including the Eclipse Delta Pack) installation.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C, caption={\emph{bla}},label={lst:shell}]
frey ~/Projekte $ mvn package -Dtycho.targetPlatform=/home/michael/Software/eclipse
\end{lstlisting}
Tests are executed as usual with maven.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C, caption={\emph{bla}},label={lst:shell}]
frey ~/Projekte $ mvn test
\end{lstlisting}
The documentation is shipped with builds for both Windows and Linux and features
a 32 and 64 bit version. The javadoc documentation can be generated with the 
following maven target
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C, caption={\emph{bla}},label={lst:shell}]
frey ~/Projekte $ mvn javadoc:javadocs
\end{lstlisting}
At present the project uses the doclava project for documentation.
