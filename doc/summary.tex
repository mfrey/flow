\section{Summary}
The goal of this work was to provide a generator for the LUA interface of the
DSM framework. Future improvements and new research directions described in  
\cite{297:Frey2010} remain still open. This includes among others the definition
of new operators, the integration of knowledge tools in the RCP application, ...

The Xtext language toolkit provides mechanisms for the creation of DSLs
and DSL workbenches. This includes among others content assists, template 
proposals and quick fixes. Future developments of the query language and the 
language workbench might provide these features. However, the 
toolkit has its limitations.
