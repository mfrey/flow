NOTES
=====
0.0.1
-----
1. Operators:
	- (arithmetic) expressions are written with the corresponding operator, e.g. add(...); 
	- operators which should be tested in terms of generated code are: avg, std, count, add, sub, 
        div, multi, join, ejoin

2. Known Issues:
	- multiple return types are not working
	- sparql-, tag-, untag-, swrl- operators need to be implemented
	- in- and out- operators need to be customized for the use of international resource identifiers
	- scoping and generators interfere in a 'chaotic' way (see also bug report on github)
